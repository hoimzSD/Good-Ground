## Design Quick Reference
### UX Copy Principles
- Tone: Warm, empowering, acknowledges hardship without leaning into toxic positivity.
- Inclusive language: Respect pronouns, cultural nuances, and neurodiversity considerations.
- Sample copy:
  - **Onboarding Welcome:** “We’re here to help you cultivate moments of joy—even on tough days. What support feels good right now?”
  - **Meeting Reminder:** “Your Positivity Circle gathers in 30 minutes. Bring one small victory to share.”
  - **Crisis Banner:** “If things feel overwhelming, connect with a counselor right away. Help is available 24/7.”

### Personalization & Experience Design
- Consent-first data requests (mood, goals, location) with clear opt-ins.
- Dynamic session recommendations based on goals, time zone, prior attendance, and language.
- Weekly emoji-scale check-ins feeding adaptive content while anonymized for reporting.
- Offline-ready practice library with downloadable guides and audio.

### Information Architecture
| Navigation Tier | Key Surfaces | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Mood check-in, recommended practices, upcoming meetings, crisis card | Crisis resources always visible, color-coded alerts |
| Meetings | Calendar, session details, facilitator bios, waitlist management | Join buttons respect accessibility sizing and labels |
| Practices | Filterable library (duration, format, goal), offline save | Filters persist, includes ASL-tagged videos |
| Resources | Directory search, map view highlighting San Diego partners, verified badges | Promote localized crisis hotlines when region = San Diego |
| Profile | Goals, consent settings, notifications, data export/delete | Transparency copy for data usage |

### Accessibility & Inclusive Design
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance (contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, focus states).
- Captions and transcripts for all media; live captions for virtual sessions.
- Language support: English, Spanish, Tagalog, with alt text for imagery and screen reader-friendly descriptions.
- Trauma-informed visual design (avoid flashing animations; offer dark/light modes).

### Diagrams & Prototypes
- **Current status:** No linked prototypes or diagrams available. Once created, store in `/docs/prototypes/` and reference here.
