# Ultimate Positivity Plan Requirements

## Purpose
- Provide a compassionate, structured hub for positivity-focused peer meetings, wellness resources, and crisis escalation pathways tailored to national and San Diego communities.
- Align product, design, and engineering teams around shared goals, success metrics, and phased delivery milestones.

## Experience Pillars
1. **Inclusive Belonging** – Ensure every participant feels seen through culturally-aware language, accessible design, and facilitators trained in trauma-informed care.
2. **Actionable Positivity** – Deliver practical exercises, goal-setting, and evidence-based positive psychology practices that produce measurable wellbeing outcomes.
3. **Safety & Trust** – Operationalize clear moderation, crisis escalation, and verification workflows to create a predictable, confidential environment.
4. **Personalized Journeys** – Leverage intake data, check-ins, and adaptive recommendations to tailor resources and meetings to individual needs while honoring privacy.

## Meeting Formats & Safety Protocols
- **Weekly Virtual Positivity Circles** (60 min, max 12 participants)
  - Agenda: Check-in, guided gratitude activity, breakout reflection, group commitments.
  - Facilitator certification: Trauma-informed training, annual renewal.
  - Safety checklist: Pre-session tech checks, pronoun sharing optional, recap of community agreements.
- **Monthly Deep-Dive Workshops** (90 min hybrid)
  - Topics rotate (resilience, purpose, community service).
  - Guest subject-matter experts vetted via background checks and references.
- **Drop-in Support Hours** (30 min virtual office hours)
  - One facilitator, open Q&A, escalation script for distress signals.
- **Safety Protocol Highlights**
  - Moderators maintain incident log in secure system within 24 hours.
  - Red flag escalation ladder: facilitator → on-call clinical advisor (≤10 min) → emergency services if imminent danger.
  - Post-incident debrief with participants within 48 hours.

## Resource Directory Schema & Workflows
- **Schema Fields**
  - `resource_id`, `name`, `description`, `category` (mental health, housing, food security, legal aid), `audience`, `coverage_region`, `contact_methods`, `hours`, `cost`, `language_support`, `verification_status`, `last_verified_at`, `owner_notes`.
- **Workflow**
  1. Intake form submitted by partner or staff → auto-create record with `verification_status = pending`.
  2. Research specialist validates credentials, services, and availability within 5 business days.
  3. Verification cadence: national resources rechecked quarterly; San Diego–specific resources rechecked bi-monthly due to local policy shifts.
  4. Publish to directory once `verification_status = active` and metadata meets accessibility standards (plain language, alt text for logos).
  5. Automated reminders and dashboards surface resources due for re-verification.

## Personalization Principles
- Consent-first data collection via transparent onboarding (opt-in to mood tracking, goal categories, location).
- Dynamic meeting suggestions based on self-reported goals, time zone, and prior attendance.
- Resource recommendations filtered by support needs, preferred language, and proximity (highlight San Diego community partners when relevant).
- Weekly check-in surveys (emoji scale + optional text) refine content feed; data anonymized for reporting.

## Moderation Guidelines
- Maintain tone of empathetic accountability; intervene on harmful language within 2 minutes.
- Zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or misinformation about mental health.
- Use pre-approved scripts for redirection and escalation.
- Maintain audit trail: timestamped chat logs, decisions, and follow-up actions retained for 12 months.
- Quarterly refresher training covering inclusive language, crisis response, and platform feature updates.
